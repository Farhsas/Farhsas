# Hello there, 👋

**`Digital Craftsman (Freelance Developer)`**

I'm a freelance, self-taught front-end developer trying to build my own version of the digital world bit by bit. Always keen to new technologies and new ways of doing things.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Farhsas's coding journey</h3></summary>
    I started my coding journey as a young 8 years old with my dad. He showed how to write my firsts line of code with simple Raspberry Pi projects. Since then I've always been interested in coding/development, so I started playing with some Raspberry Pi and Arduino Projects.
    But during my college time, I discovered Web development and I immediately liked it. So I started to learn about HTML/CSS/JS to make websites. And why websites, you may ask ? I've always been a creative person and creating websites from scratch using my knowledge fitted me best. But I also like security adn everything attached to it. 
    So I'm ready to enter 2023 with a grind mindset to elevate my knowledge even further to build new application.
    As W. Clemetn Stone said : "Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star".
